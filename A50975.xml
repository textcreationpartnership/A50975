            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMongst all the Symptomes of an approaching Misery and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to any People, none is more significant and fatal, than a general slighting and neglecting of the great Signs which God openly sheweth, and the wonderful things, which (as on a publick Theater) he is pleased to act in the sight of all men. As <hi>they</hi> are the plainest and most obvious to sence, so they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the <hi>last</hi> Sermons which God intends to preach to a Nation or Kingdom, before he inflicts his Punishments upon them, if they repent not. The Preaching of the Word is his <hi>Barnabas,</hi> whom he <hi>first</hi> sends as his <hi>Ambassador,</hi> with gentleness and sweetness to treat with us, yea, to beseech us as in <hi>Christ's</hi> stead, to be reconciled unto <hi>God.</hi> But when <hi>he</hi> is rejected, then doth he commissionate some strange and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Providences, as his <hi>Boanerges,</hi> to thunder-out his peremptory and irrevokable Purpose, in case of incorrigibleness, speedily to proceed to Judgment.<note place="margin">Exod. 5.1.</note>
               <hi>Moses</hi> his first Sermon to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a gentle word from the Lord; <hi>Let my People go, that they may serve me.</hi> But that being slighted, <hi>Moses</hi> opens his second Commission, and shews Signs and Wonders in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which to the <hi>life</hi> did preach <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's death,</hi> if his heart was yet so hardened that none of those things can make impressions upon him. The World shall certainly find, that if neither the Word nor Works of God do prevail with them, his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shall inevitably prevail against them to overthrow them. If the shaking of the Rod over us doth us no good, be assured that the Hand which shakes it over us, will immediately strike us with it. It is the Observation of famous Dr. <hi>Jackson,</hi> in a Treatise of his, called <hi>The Signs of the Times:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 26</note>
               <hi>being the Sum of some few Sermons prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before the King, &amp;c.</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">That the destruction threatned by our Saviour against <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> though at that time it was truly evitable, yet it became less evitable every day than other for almost forty years, by their continual perseverance in special sins; and their progression in sin without repentance, was occasioned by the neglect of the Signs of the Time, or the fore-warnings which God had given them for their good. No publick Plagues or Calamities, whether fore-signified by Signs, or punctually foretold by God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or by his Son the Prince of Prophets, become inevitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be by contempt or neglect of fore-warnings given.</q> And in another place of the same <hi>Treatise</hi> he sayes,<note place="margin">Pag. 36</note>
               <q rend="margQuotes">That the Church and
<pb facs="tcp:56129:3"/> People of the <hi>Jews</hi> had many signs of the miserable ruine and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Country, which they might have observed, and which if they had observed in such measure and manner, as many Heathens did the like, they might have been acquitted a <hi>tanto,</hi> though not a <hi>toto.</hi> But their ruine and destruction after it became in a manner necessary; it was not necessarily decreed to be so inevitable, as by their own stubborness they made it to be in the issue.</q> Thus far the Doctor. And O how applicable are his words to us in <hi>England</hi> at this day? whom God hath for so many years together warned by his Word, and in these two last years hath given us more warnings by <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Prodigies,</hi> than (so far as we have heard or read) the whole <hi>World</hi> hath had since the dayes of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> his being on the Earth to this very day. What remains then, but that if after all this we harden our hearts, as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Galileans</hi> did, our Saviour should exempt us, as he did them, from his special Protection; and leave us open, as he did them, to the ordinary process of God's just and righteous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.<note place="margin">Joh. 4.48.</note> If <hi>Christ</hi> did so much blame those, <hi>that would not believe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they saw signs and wonders,</hi> how much more think we will he rebuke those who will not believe nor repent though they see Signs and Wonders? So that we may say, Oh happy People indeed, in the midst of whom God works Wonders to forewarn them; but Oh most unhappy People, who will not take warning when he works Wonders amongst them. We have no cause in the least to take up any complaint against God whatever his proceedings hereafter should be against us: For, as <hi>Josephus</hi> in his seventh Book of the Wars of the <hi>Jews,</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi> observes upon the appearance of those strange Signs before the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">That God hath a care of Mankind, and doth every way foreshew betime what is most expedient for them: but they through madness do voluntarily perish in their wickedness. The <hi>Jews</hi> (says he further in the close of the same chap.) interpreted some of the Signs as they pleased, and at others they laughed, till by the ruine of their Country, and their own woful overthrow, their iniquity appeared.</q> So, if we seriously reflect upon the present hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and temper of the generality of the People in <hi>England</hi> at this day, how little credit and regard is given by them to the Signs of the Time (though so many in number, and most of them so strange and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable) we have sufficient ground to expect,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.27.</note>
               <hi>that our fear is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Desolation, and our Destruction as a Whirlwind.</hi> Can there be a greater affront offered to the Mighty JEHOVAH, than to contemn and laugh at that which he doth on purpose that it might be
<pb facs="tcp:56129:3"/>
               <hi>considered?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 111.4.</note>
               <hi>He makes</hi> (sayes the Psalmist) <hi>his wonderful Works to be remembred.</hi> That is the Design of <hi>God</hi> in what he doth, he hath made all his Works to that end that they should be <hi>considered</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to</hi> by us. How bold and daring then are those men <hi>who regard not the Works of the Lord, nor consider the Operation of his hands?</hi> and thereby provoke him <hi>to destroy them, and not build them up,</hi> as the Psalmist expresses it, <hi>Psal. 28.5.</hi> The Heathens themselves <hi>will rise up in the Judgment against the men of this Generation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Plin. lib. 2. c. 58. Voetius <hi>de Signis,</hi> 3. pag. 920.</note> For when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever any Prodigies or strange Apparitions hapned amongst them, they were still very sensible of them, as is manifest from all their <hi>Histories.</hi> Yea, according to <hi>Voetius</hi> his observation upon the happening of any particular <hi>Prodigy,</hi> they still applyed themselves to their particular <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> for avoiding the evil of that <hi>Prodigy.</hi> Yea, some of the chiefest amongst them have been so affected with things of this nature, that they have been a means to bring them to the knowledge and worship of the <hi>true God:</hi> as appears by that famous Instance of <hi>Dionysius Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagita</hi> the eminent Philosopher, who was converted to the Christian Faith by a Prodigie, as himself tells us in that excellent Epistle of his to <hi>Polycarpus.</hi> How strangely also did they work upon <hi>Nebuchadnezzar?</hi> insomuch that he infers from them no less than the Eternity of God's Kingdom, saying, <hi>How great are his Signs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4.3.</note>
               <hi>and how mighty are his Wonders? his Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from Generation to Generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So likewise <hi>Darius</hi> makes the same Inference from the same Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: for, speaking of God, as one that works <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> in Heaven and in Earth, concludes, <hi>That he is the living God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 6.26.</note>
               <hi>and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast for ever, and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his Dominion shall be to the end.</hi> But the wickedness of this Age is such, that the <hi>great Works</hi> of the <hi>Almighty</hi> are not only disregarded and neglected, but even <hi>scorned</hi> and <hi>villified</hi> by the greatest part of men, who see and hear of them every day. Yea, the more visibly God doth from Heaven testifie against the Prophane, Superstitious, Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, and Persecuting Spirit of this day, the greater progress is made in the filling up of the measure of these several Abominations. So that by this progressive motion in Sin and Wickedness, without any sense or remorse at all, in the midst of so many Prodigies, they proclaim them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be the most monstrous Prodigies of all. Yea, it is to be wished, that the People of God themselves could be excused in this matter, who we fear have great cause to be humbled and to lye very low, in regard of <hi>their</hi> neglect also of the Signs of the Time, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
<pb facs="tcp:56129:4"/> them to a competency of fitness <hi>to meet the Lord in the way of his Judgments,</hi> and to an encouragement of their Faith concerning the sudden <hi>appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> whose <hi>second coming</hi> these are the certain Harbengers and immediate fore-runners of.</p>
            <p>Our Scope therefore in publishing some of the strange Apparitions and Prodigious Events which have happened this last year, is nothing else but to alarm both Saints and Sinners, to awaken both the <hi>wise</hi> and the <hi>foolish Virgins,</hi> that none may be surprized with his coming, nor continue in a course of Sin and Rebellion against God, without fair warnings of approaching Judgments, as the natural and direct conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of such enormities. And this we do upon that supposition which God himself makes in relation to the Israelites,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.8.</note>
               <hi>If they will not</hi> (sayes the Lord) <hi>hearken to the voice of the first Sign, they will believe the voice of the latter Sign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Above a Century of them was published the last year, but against them these two great Exceptions were taken. First, That they were all false. And, secondly, that several seditious <hi>Parallels</hi> were annexed to many of them, to give their meaning and interpretation.</p>
            <p>Now (though there be no obligation upon us to vindicate what was then performed by others) yet for Truths sake we shall briefly speak to both these Exceptions.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>first,</hi> we shall only say this short word, That of the <hi>truth</hi> of many of them, the generality of the whole Kingdom are upon clear and publick evidence convinced: As the several <hi>Parelia's,</hi> the <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing-Stars,</hi> the <hi>strange fiery Meteors,</hi> the dreadful <hi>storms</hi> of <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Lightning, Hail, Whirlwinds</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> with many others: all which happened in divers places, and whereof many hundreds were Witnesses in several parts of the Nation; As also the strange double Tides at <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Hull,</hi> the drying up of the River <hi>Derwent,</hi> and several, if not the major part of the <hi>Accidents</hi> and <hi>Judgments,</hi> were then, and have been often since confirmed by publick Testimony. Most of the rest, according to the best enquiry that we could since make, do upon fair and sufficient Proof appear to be in substance very certain, though there may be a fayler in setting down some circumstances which do relate to some of them: Some few of them, at least in some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, we acknowledge are very doubtful; As the <hi>53.</hi> (under the head of <hi>Prodigies in the Heavens</hi>) is doubtful in respect of many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, as they are there set down, though in the substance the Narrative is very true. So also the 11th (under the head of <hi>Prodigies
<pb facs="tcp:56129:4"/> on the Earth</hi>) in respect of the last part of it (which is a story of two Children, &amp;c.) was (so far as we are able to inform our selves) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon very slender proof, and the truth of it doth not at all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. And so in the 4th (under the head of <hi>Accidents and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>) there is a mistake of <hi>Leicestershire</hi> for <hi>Warwickshire.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the 9th (under the same head) there is much wrong done to the young Gentlewoman therein mentioned, who (as we have heard from very good hands) was not so great a <hi>Reviler</hi> of <hi>Religious people,</hi> nor so <hi>eminently</hi> struck by the hand of the Lord, as that story relates. Also the 18th (under the same head) is not true in that particular about the Apothecary's venting after his death so great a quantity of blood, and in that manner as is there said, though the rest of the story is <hi>undoubtedly true.</hi> That also concerning the Gentleness of the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher's Dog in the <hi>21.</hi> (under the same head) is mistaken: for the Dog was wont to do mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="8 letters">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ8 lettersã€‰</desc>
               </gap> of the like nature formerly: the rest of the Relation holds true. The last thing which we have any doubt of the truth of, is the 24th (under the same head) wherein, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, there are these two mistakes: the one, that the person there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned was subject formerly to that noysom disease which that Relation doth not own; and the other, that he was not then dead as is there reported. Besides these seven particulars, we know not any one of all the rest that the Impartial Reader hath any just cause to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, or that stands in need of the least emendation. And indeed that which should encourage every one to give the more credit to the whole Narrative, is, That now after a years time, and some months over, the falshood of any one particular hath not been publickly detected, though the whole was condemned as fictitious and scandalous, and the discovery of the <hi>Imposture</hi> of it undertaken by those who would have had no mercy on it, if they could have got it fairly under their whip; but they altogether fayling in their enterprize, and proving meer Bragadocia's in all their boasts and threats, the <hi>Book</hi> stands now in the Judgment of all indifferent and unbyassed men <hi>rectus in Curia,</hi> and may doubtless in a <hi>second Edition,</hi> with the blind of some few <hi>lean Animadversions,</hi> come forth under the Protection of a <hi>mercinary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other <hi>Exception</hi> was, That so many <hi>Parallels</hi> were inserted, which in the ears of many did trumpet out nothing less than <hi>Sedition and Rebellion.</hi> To which we shall only say, That if any such thing were intended or designed by them, we cannot but openly testifie our Abhorrency of such Practices. The publishing of the Works of God
<pb facs="tcp:56129:5"/> ought not by any means to be made use of as a project to further and promote that which is so plainly repugnant to the Word of God. And we do ingenuously confess (though the Authors design might be never so innocent) yet that Collection of Parallels might well have been spared, in regard there was at least <hi>an appearance</hi> of ground for all those Imputations which were cast upon the <hi>Book</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> also for their sakes. We have therefore purposely avoided that Rock, and have given only a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> account of the several remarkable passages of Providence which (by the best information that those parts where the things themselves were transacted would afford) we have come to the knowledge of. And herein, we call the Searcher of all hearts to witness, that we have been faithful and impartial. And truly, we can appeal to the <hi>all-knowing God,</hi> that our design is not to stir up any to <hi>Sedition,</hi> but <hi>seasonable Repentance;</hi> not to <hi>Treason</hi> against <hi>man,</hi> but <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>JESUS CHRIST the King of kings and Lord of lords.</hi> And if in this respect, by our care and diligence in putting together and publishing this Collection, we can be serviceable to our <hi>Master,</hi> and the souls of men, we have our end, and a sufficient Compensation for all our pains and travel in this Work. Which we pray the Lord may be accompanied with his special blessing; and in this day wherein our best Preachers are driven into corners, and there is like to be so great a famine of the Word, every one of these particular Works of the Lord may be a lively quickning Sermon to the whole Nation, and that they may prove an effectual Warning to all, to break off their Sins by a timely <hi>Gospel-Repentance,</hi> lest the Lord, as he threatens by his Prophet, become <hi>a Lion unto</hi> Ephraim,<note place="margin">Hos. 5.14.</note>

Both their horses were so affrighted that they stood still and would not go forward; the Captain, after the fright was somewhat over, felt on his horses main, and when he came to his Inn, searched him with a Candle, supposing his hair had been singed, in regard the Fire fell so near them.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56129:9"/> his Orchyard at <hi>Ipswich</hi> about ten of the clock in the morning, plainly saw in the Firmament Three Suns together, the one of them was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bigger than the other two, which also had a great circle round about it, of the colour of a Rainbow: the two other Suns were on each side of this. A Contributer to this Collection received the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from the Ministers own mouth.</p>

               <p>About the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> 1661, upon a Monday or Tuesday, about two of the clock in the morning, at <hi>Stoak</hi> under <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in <hi>Somersetshire,</hi> four persons went forth together to cut Beans in the Field; and as they begun to enter upon their work, they heard first a very great Noise as if it had been the crack of a great Tree when it breaks and falls: They heard it again the second time, whereby they were so terrified, that they left off their cutting of Beans imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. After this, they heard the noise of the beating of a Drum; and one of the company being a Drummer, (and now in the King's Army) could distinguish the several beatings, who affirms there was first a Call beaten, and after that a Battail, which continued a good space of time, and in the midst of it a great Skreeking, and a harsh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused noise like the clattering of Armour, and the groaning of Dying-men: This whole Scene was repeated four several times successively. They heard the Noise, sometimes as near them, sometimes as farther off, till the day brake, and then all ceased: only immediately after it, they heard a more than ordinary roaring and bellowing of the Cattel that were in the Pastures adjacent. These persons were so exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affrighted at what they heard, that they were sometimes resolved to run away for fear; but being four of them together, they animated one another, and stayed it out. They have been often examined and threatned about this thing, but they all joyntly attest the truth of the whole Relation, which is so notoriously known in those parts, that he that will take the pains to enquire after it, will receive ample satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the premises.</p>

               <p>In the fore-mentioned month of <hi>September,</hi> some persons of known discretion and credit in the East part of <hi>Sussex,</hi> saw an Apparition of Clouds in the Air of various colours, some black, some white, &amp;c. which were carried in the Air with a swift motion by a great wind. After the passing away of the Clouds towards the East, there appeared the likeness of three Pulpits, each Pulpit having a Canopy or sounding board with Pinacles over it; and in every of them he saw the form of a Man with a black Cap on his head: presently after there appeared a great company of Armed men close by them, and the Pulpit doors flew open, and the Armed men forced them out of the Pulpits, and one of them fell down as on the Earth; they were by these Armed men dragged from the Pulpits, and so all vanished. A while after there appeared two Carts, having wheels, and an Horse in each Cart, and at the end of each of them was tied a Rope, made fast to two Men, girded about the middle; and to the Spectators apprehensions they were drawn with their feet and toes, as if upon the ground, along the edge of a Cloud; and about that time it thundered and lightened, which made them with fear to depart immediately, and so they saw no more.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56129:10"/> direct Cloud in its proper region; and as they stood looking up and gazing upon it, they plainly saw the Cloud open, and therein beheld (as they all apprehended) the form and proportion of a tall black Man, with a thin meager countenance, who seemed to move to and fro very swiftly, and then suddenly vanished; And after this the Cloud closed again, and within a very little while they saw it open the second time, and then there appeared a Man on horseback, who moved to and fro with very great swiftness for a very short space of time, and soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared: upon which, the Cloud immediately (as before) was shut up, but presently opening again the third time, there appeared the form of a very comely and beautiful Lady, who after she had for a while moved backwards and forwards (as the other two had done before) vanished also, and then the whole Cloud dispersed.

As soon as the Sun appeared a little above the Horizon, they saw another Sun arising gradually also, as the former did, on the South side of it; which, when it had also gotten up above the Horizon, did shine with equal brightness (to their apprehension) with the former: Immediately after this they saw a third Sun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing above the other two, not so big, or bright, but as visible as either of them. They all three continued a good space of time as it were in a Triangle: the persons coming near the City and going down a great Hill, lost the sight of them.

               <p>At a Town called <hi>Arle,</hi> in or near the County of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> the People were so terrified at the great Storm, which happened on the 18th of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1661.

We doubt not of the truth of this Relation, having received it from honest credible persons, near adjoyning in their habitation to the Town before-mentioned, who do assure us of the truth hereof from some of the Spectators themselves.</p>

It was not as he judged above three times the height of the Trees in the Park, and moved with a very swift motion from the Southwest to the Northeast.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56129:17"/> very clear and bright, and in it was seen a Man on horseback very perfectly: in a short space after there appeared another Sun, about two yards distance (as was conceived) from the first Sun on the North side of it, then immediately appeared very plainly a Man on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back in this other Sun; also both these Men on horseback for some small space of time stood and faced each other: after that, on the West side of the real Sun, was seen a great Army fixed, but because of the multiplicity of them, it could not be easily discerned whether they were Horse or Foot: But there was plainly seen another Army both of Horse and Foot coming out of the North, and marching very near the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Sun, and then they made a halt for a very short space of time, and then moved again, and marched very swiftly into the Northern Sun, upon which the Man on horseback in the first Sun, checked his horse, and moved backward to the West, and to the head of the Western Army, which remained fixed. Immediately after this, both Suns joyned together in one, and the Northern Army advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North-west point, and that, with the other Army also, was seen no more; and immediately the Sun set, and upon its going down was very bloody and fiery; and the Fields on both sides for about the space of four or five miles appeared as if they had been full of Fire and Blood, to the great astonishment of the Spectators.

After this they saw the Sun (as they conceived) divided into three parts, each of which seemed to be very sharp at both ends; there was a pretty space in the middest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the parts wherein they clearly beheld the form of a Man riding on a Horse, with Saddle and Bridle, shaking the Bridle.

               <p>On the same 14th of <hi>July</hi> 1662, eight or nine persons, Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>North-Willingham,</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> being at work together in the Field, near <hi>Market Rason,</hi> about two hours before the setting of the Sun, did on a suddain hear a most melodious sound of Musick, at which they were much amazed; and looking up into the Air (from whence they conceived the sound came) they plainly saw a yellowish Cloud, let down very low, which to their apprehensions seemed to be toward, if not directly over the City of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> about twelve Miles distant from them. In this Cloud they saw a great company of Men marching towards them in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary posture, like an Army in Rank and File; under their Feet seemed to be a very black mist, which moved with very great swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; they came very near to the Spectators, passing by them in very good order, and so went quickly out of their sight. After these there immediately followed, in the very same manner, a great company of Youths; and after them, in the same manner, a great company of Children; the Musick all this while sounding louder and louder till at length the whole disappeared. This is a thing publickly known in those parts of the Country, and no doubt at all made of it, being unanimously and constantly attested by all the Spectators.</p>

Not long after he was dead, as his Widow and Children were sitting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a low Parlour, there came down the Chimney (in a great and dreadful storm of Thunder and Lightning) a Ball of Fire, to their great terrour and affrightment: It burned the Wainscot very much, and at last made its way through the Ceeling into an upper Room, where the Corps was laid out, and did some injury to it; and going through se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rooms, and doing much prejudice to the House, it went out at the top of the House. The Gentlewoman and the whole Family were very much terrified at it, and upon this occasion the Funeral was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly solemnized, some dayes sooner than otherwise was intended: And some of the Neighbourhood do confidently report, that the Coffin which was carried to be buried was very light, and there was a great jealousie that the Corps was carried away in that dreadful storm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned: But whether that be true or no, is very uncertain; and therefore it is left to the Reader to make further enqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

The Midwife was so affrighted at this birth that she fell ill immediately, and was not recovered in some weeks after; And having since been enquired of about it by some of her honest Neighbours, she professeth, that she was so extreamly affrighted at the sight of it, that she is not able to give a perfect account of what she was instrumental to bring into the world; Only she saith, that it had a head like a Colt, and ears like a Sheep, and two stumps of horns upon its head, and two great staring eyes which stood behind the head: It was mouthed and nosed like a Colt, and from the waste downwards like other Children.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56129:20"/> Thus much the Midwife hath affirmed to be true; the defect of whose Relation is supplyed by persons of known integrity, who were present when this Monster was brought into the world, of whom we have received the afore-mentioned Information.

               <p>About the time before-mentioned, one Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> of <hi>Devonshire,</hi> son to Sir <hi>Nicholas Martin</hi> deceased, walking in his Grounds, was on a sudden most furiously assaulted by two Ravens, who endeavoured to have picked out his eyes. He defended himself as well as he could till he came to an heap of stones, and then took up a stone and flung
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56129:20"/> at the Ravens; immediately he felt a very great pain in the arm which he threw the stone with. He made what haste he could into his house, and grew worse and worse, so that within two or three dayes he was forced to send for the Doctor; and as his servant was going for him, two Ravens set upon him also; but he defended himself against them, and so far as we are informed, received no dammage by them. When the Doctor came the Gentleman was past recovery, and before he died, the Bell in the Steeple tolled three hours together of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: but assoon as the breath went out of his Body, the Bell ceased tolling. This was received from a near Relation of the said Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> and is most certainly true.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56129:21"/> with Ivy; at which sight, being very much surprized, and distrusting the evidence of his eyes, he felt on it, and tryed with his Bill whether it was real stone or no, and to his thinking it was. And besides, he saith, that as he made his Faggots, they did brush against the Walls of it: and for further satisfaction he attempted to go into it, but then he could not discover either Door or Window though before he thought he saw both. It continued about the space of four or five hours, and then of a sudden disappeared, not leaving the least sign thereof behind it. He affirms further, that it was very like a Church, called <hi>Stone-Church,</hi> about five miles distant from the place where he saw this appearance; which was, as we are credibly informed, one of those Churches which were fired by Lightning, a little before the beginning of our late Civil Wars. This whole Relation was taken from the man's own mouth by a person of quality, who went over to him for satisfaction in the particulars, which he received according to the Account which hath already been given; and is notoriously known by all the Neighbourhood in those parts.</p>

And that they, observing how long they marched in their view, concluded, that the said Horsemen, though in their marching they made no stand at all, were at least half an hour in passing by, before the Rear of them attained to the place where they first saw the Front: So that though there was some difference amongst the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in their conjectures about the number, some judging them to be near a Thousand Horse, yet all agree thus far, that upon their view they appeared to be Five hundred at the least. The Deponents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much amazed at so sudden an appearance of such a great number of Souldiers (as they conceived them to be) concluded they were an Army of <hi>Roundheads</hi> or <hi>Phanaticks</hi> going to relieve the Prisoners at <hi>Mountgomery</hi> (there being at that time several Gentlemen and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of that County under restraint in a Martial Prison in the said

They also discovered that they marched in three several Bodies, and betwixt every Body two Horse-Colours flying. The aforesaid Messenger, with some others of the Spectators, made what haste they could after them, and endeavoured to overtake the Rear of them; but they seemed still to be at the same distance from them, and could never get nearer to them than about the space of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards.</p>
               <p>And further the said Deponents do affirm, That there was a man thatching all that day upon an House, which in the sight of the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents the Horsemen did march close by; who being demanded by them, whether he saw that great Company of Souldiers which passed by the house? replyed, that he saw none. It is also most certain, that there were no tracks of the Horses either that night, or the next morning visible to any of those, who went purposely to view the Wayes: Whereupon, they conclude it to be a wonderful Apparition; and it is indeed a matter of great admiration and astonishment to the whole Country, it being so publickly known to be a most real and certain truth.</p>
               <p>It is also credibly reported by very Honourable persons, that the King and Council have had a true Information of the particular Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions from the Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> and are satisfied in the truth of them.</p>

               <p>It is credibly reported by many honest and discreet persons, Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Reading</hi> in the County of <hi>Berks,</hi> That about <hi>January</hi> last, there appeared several times a <hi>Spectrum</hi> in the likeness of old Mr. <hi>Blagrave,</hi> who while he lived dwelt in an House of his own near <hi>Reading,</hi> and when he dyed gave it to Mr. <hi>Daniel Blagrave,</hi> one of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56129:23"/> the <hi>Long Parliament,</hi> and also one that <hi>sate upon the Tryal of the late King,</hi> by reason whereof this House is <hi>forfeited</hi> to the King, who hath bestowed it upon one who now lives in it. The <hi>Spectrum,</hi> as it is reported, hath sometimes met with some of this Gentleman's servants, either in or about the House, and hath warned them upon a great penalty to leave the House, that the Proprietor may enjoy it. That which makes this to be the more taken notice of amongst the people there, is, That after old Mr. <hi>Blagrave</hi> dyed, and Mr. <hi>Daniel Blagrave's</hi> elder Brother had by some unjust practices obtained pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the said House, the same <hi>Spectrum</hi> then appeared, and did warn out the present Inhabitants, saying to them several times, that the House belonged not to them, but to the said <hi>Daniel;</hi> upon which the difference betwixt the two Brothers was suddenly composed, and <hi>Daniel</hi> had quiet possession of the House according to that Settlement which old Mr. <hi>Blagrave</hi> had made, until the time of the late Wars, and that <hi>Reading</hi> was a Garrison for the King; at which time the King bestowed it upon one that begged it: But he and his servants were often disquieted by the same <hi>Spectrum,</hi> and were warned spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to depart, and resign up the possession again to <hi>Daniel Blagrave,</hi> who had a just and legal right to it. And not long after the Garrison of <hi>Reading</hi> being reduced by the Parliaments Forces under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Earl of <hi>Essex, Daniel Blagrave</hi> was repossessed of his House, and so enjoyed it till it became now forfeited to his Majesty, because of his Attainder by the late Act of Parliament. All these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral passages are attested by many honest and credible persons, and we presume, that upon enquiry the whole Narrative will be found to be certainly true.</p>

               </head>
               <p>On the 28th of <hi>January</hi> 1661, betimes in the morning, near <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sup</hi> in <hi>Notinghamshire,</hi> there was an appearance of a gallant Troop of Horse marching towards one Mr. <hi>Leak's</hi> house (who was High-Sheriff the last year, and a violent opposer of sober and good men, who were not of his perswasion in matters of Religion) several But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and others, who were travelling toward <hi>Worsup,</hi> met this Troop in the Road, and gave them the way, and stood still to behold them as they marched along; who affirm that the Riders were very goodly proper persons, and exceeding well armed and mounted: The Officers (as they report) marched in their respective places, and the Troopers
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56129:23"/> kept their ranks exactly. Also they report, that in their sight one of the horses threw his Rider, who mounted again presently with great agility, and fell immediately into his own rank and place again. Mr. <hi>Leak</hi> having speedy intelligence of the marching of this Troop towards his house, forthwith hasted away to the Marquess of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> who lived not far from him, and informed his Lordship, that the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> were up in great numbers. The Marquess (as it is reported) upon enquiry found, that no Troops either such as were under his Lordships command, or any other sort of people, did really march in an hostile manner that day, and therefore concluded that it was an Appearance like to that in <hi>Wales</hi> on the 20th of <hi>December,</hi> whereof we have before given an exact and perfect account. This is a thing much spoken of in the Country, and by very credible and knowing persons reported to be most certainly true; But we remit the Reader to a further enquiry for more full and ample satisfaction in these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>

                  <hi>XX.</hi> A dreadful Storm of Fire and Hail mingled together.</head>
               <p>On the first of <hi>February</hi> 1661, about six of the clock in the evening, there happened about <hi>Northampton</hi> a very strange and dreadful storm of Hail, and Fire mingled with the Hail in some places. It did run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground in great sheets of Fire for a great way together. Others saw the Fire fall upon the Earth, which seemed to be covered with it, as with Glow-worms. Others observed it to fall upon their Horses heads like drops of Fire from a Brimstone-match. One that travelled from <hi>Northampton,</hi> had his Stick, or Whip, burned by the Fire, even to a coal, which divers honest and credible persons have seen, and do attest the truth of it. The Fire did fall upon some part of <hi>Wellingbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> Town in the County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and particularly upon some Sheep-skins in a Felmongers yard in the said Town and when they shook it off it sparkled like Fire, but the skins were not so much as singed by it. Divers very credible persons do report, that there was Blood also mingled with the Hail and the Fire: and particularly, one of much credit in <hi>Kettering,</hi> not far from <hi>Northampton,</hi> who was that evening in the Storm, affirms, that though while he was abroad he saw nothing but Hail and Fire, Yet, when he came home he found that his Coat was very full of spots of Blood. Of this Storm we have received a particular and exact account from very many persons, who themselves were in it as they travelled that night from <hi>Northampton</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56129:24"/> Market; and it is a thing so eminently known in those parts, that none need in the least to question the truth of it.</p>

Sometimes also when the Doors were left fast shut over-night, they have been found wide open the next morning when the Officer who kept the Keys all night came to open them; yet none could discern that any violent means had been used to break them open. And one morning when the Prebends would have entred the <hi>Audit-house,</hi> to seal some Leases, or to do some other profitable busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in behalf of the Chapter, the Officer could not by any means at that time unlock the Door; though he had locked it very well the night before: A Smith was sent for to break the Door open, but all his Art failed him, and he was not able to do it; insomuch, that they were constrained to dig an hole through a very thick Wall, and go in that way into the House: and at their entrance (according to our best Information) they found the Writings and Money thrown about the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56129:24"/> Room as before. It is also very confidently reported, that the Organs have sometimes played of their own accord at eleven or twelve of the clock at night.

               <p>Upon the 18th of <hi>February</hi> 1661, being Tuesday, very early in the morning, there began a very great and dreadful Storm of Wind (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Thunder, Lightning, Hail, and Rain, which in many places was salt as Brine) which continued with a strange and unusual violence till almost night: the sad Effects whereof throughout the Nation are so many, that a very great Volumn is not sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Narrative of them. And indeed some of them are so stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and amazing, that the report of them, though from never so authentick hands, will scarce gain credit among any but those that have an affectionate sense of the unlimited Power of the Almighty, knowing and believing that there is nothing too hard for Him to do.</p>
               <p>Some few of which wonderful Effects we shall give a brief account of, as we have received them from persons of most unquestionable credit in the several parts of the Nation.</p>

               </p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56129:25"/>
               <p>From other parts likewise we have received certain Information, that divers persons were killed by the Effects of this great Wind.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Chiltenham</hi> in <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> a Maid was killed by the fall of a Tree, in or near the Church-yard.</p>
               <p>An honest Yeoman likewise of <hi>Scaldwel</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> being upon a Ladder to save his Hovel, was blown off, and fell upon a Plough, dyed outright and never spake word more.</p>
               <p>Also at <hi>Tewksbury</hi> in <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> a Man was blown from an House and broken to pieces.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Elsby</hi> likewise in the same County, a Woman was killed by the fall of Tiles or Bricks from an House.</p>
               <p>And not far from the same place, a Girl was killed by the fall of a Tree.</p>
               <p>Near <hi>Northampton</hi> a Man was killed by the fall of a great Barne.</p>
               <p>Near <hi>Colchester,</hi> a young man was killed by the fall of a Wind-mill.</p>
               <p>Not far from <hi>Ipswich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> a Man was killed by the fall of a Barne.</p>
               <p>And about two miles from the said Town of <hi>Ipswich,</hi> a Man was killed by the fall of a Tree.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Langton,</hi> or near to it, in the County of <hi>Leicester,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> had a Wind-mill blown down, in which were three Men, and by the fall of it, one of them was killed outright, a second had his back broken, and the other had his arm or leg struck off, and both of them (according to our best Information) are since dead.</p>
               <p>Several other Instances there are of the like nature, but it would be too tedious to mention them: Let these therefore suffice to stir us up to Repentance, <hi>lest we likewise perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are also many Effects of this Storm which are of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereof we shall give this following brief account.</p>
               <p>This Wind hath very much prejudiced many Churches in several parts of the Nation.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Tewksbury</hi> in <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> it blew down a very fair Window belonging to the Church there, both the Glass and the Stone-work also; the Doors likewise of that Church were blown open, much of the Lead torn up, and some part of a fair Pinacle thrown down.</p>
               <p>Also at <hi>Red-Marly</hi> and <hi>Newin,</hi> not far from <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are extreamly broken and shattered, if not a considerable part of them blown down. The like was done to most, if not all the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meeting-places at <hi>Gloucester</hi> City. And it is reported that some hundreds of pounds will not suffice to repair the dammage done to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56129:26"/> Cathedral at <hi>Worcester,</hi> especially in that part that is over the Quire.</p>
               <p>The like fate happened to many more of them, as <hi>Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Leighton Beau-desart</hi> in <hi>Bedfordshire,</hi> and <hi>Eaton Soken</hi> in the same County, where they had newly erected a very fair Crosse of Stone, which the Wind blew down; and, as some of the Inhabitants did observe, that was the first dammage which that Town sustained by the Storm, though afterwards in other respects also they were in the same condition with their Neighbours. The Steeples also and other parts of the Churches of <hi>Shenley, Whaddon,</hi> and <hi>Woolston</hi> in the County of <hi>Bucks</hi> have been very much rent and torn by the Wind. The Spire of <hi>Finchinfield</hi> Steeple in the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> was blown down, and it brake through the body of the Church and spoyled many of the Pews; some hundreds of pounds will not repair that loss. But that which is most remarkable of this kind, is, the fall of that famous Spire, or Pinacle of the Tower-Church in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> It was blown down upon the body of the Church, and fell reversed, the sharp end of the Shaft striking through the Leads on the South-side of the Church, carried much of the Timber-work down before it into the Alley just behind the Pulpit, and took off the edge off one side of the Sounding-board over the Pulpit. It shattered many Pews. The Weather-Cock, and the Iron upon which it stood, broke off as it fell, but the narrowest part of the Wood-work, upon which the Fane stood, fell into the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, broke quite through a Grave-stone, and ran shoring under two Coffins that had been placed there one over another. That part of the Spire which was pluck'd up was about three yards deep in the earth, and it is believed some part of it is yet behind in the ground: some hundreds of pounds will not make good the detriment done to the Church by the fall of this Pinacle.</p>
               <p>Very great prejudice hath been done also to private houses, many of them blown down, and others extreamly shattered and torn. It is thought that five thousand pounds will not make good the Repairs at <hi>Audly-end house</hi> which belongs to the Earl of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> A good part also of the Crown-Office in the <hi>Temple</hi> is blown down. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this kind are so many and so obvious, that it would need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly take up too much time to give the Reader an account of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of them, only, there hath been such a wonderful destruction of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rns, that (looking so much like a Judgment from the Lord, who the last year took away our Corn, and this year our Barns) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but give a short account of some part of that Intelligence which hath come to our hands of that nature.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:56129:26"/>
               <p>A Gentleman of good account in <hi>Ipswich</hi> affirms, that in a few miles riding that day, there were eleven Barns and Out-houses blown down in the Road, within his view; and within a very few miles of <hi>Ipswich</hi> round about, above thirty Barns, and many of them with Corn in them, were blown down. At <hi>Southold,</hi> not far from the place before-mentioned, many new Houses and Barns, built since a late Fire that happened there, are blown down, as also a Salt-house is destroyed t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ere; and 1000 l. as it is believed, will not make up that particular loss.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Tewksbury</hi> it is certified, that an incredible number of Barns have been blown down in the small Towns and Villages thereabouts. At <hi>Twyning,</hi> at least eleven Barns are blown down. In <hi>Ashchurch</hi> Parish seven or eight. At <hi>Lee,</hi> five. At <hi>Norton,</hi> a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, three whereof belonged to one man. The great Abby-Barn also at <hi>Tewksbury</hi> is blown down.</p>
               <p>It is credibly reported, that within a very few miles circumference in <hi>Worcestershire,</hi> about an hundred and forty Barns are blown down. At <hi>Finchinfield</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> which is but an ordinary Village, about six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Barns were blown down. Also at a Town called <hi>Wilchamsted</hi> in the County of <hi>Bedford</hi> (a very small Village) fifteen Barns at least are blown down. But especially the Parsonage Barns went to wrack in many places throughout the Land. In a few miles compass in <hi>Bedford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> and so in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> &amp; other places, eight, ten and twelve are blown down: and at <hi>Yelding Parsonage</hi> in the County of <hi>Bedford</hi> (out of which was thrust by oppression and violence the late Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent) all the Barns belonging to it are down. The instances also of this kind are innumerable, which we shall therefore forbear to make further mention of.</p>
               <p>We have also a large Account of the blowing down of a very great and considerable number of Fruit-trees, and other Trees in several parts; we shall onely pick out two or three passages which are the most remarkable. In the Counties of <hi>Gloucester, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Worcester,</hi> several persons have lost whole Orchards of Fruit-trees; and many particular men's loss hath amounted to the value of fourty or fifty pounds at the least, meerly by the destruction of their Fruit-trees; and so in other parts of <hi>England</hi> proportionably the like dammage hath been sustained in this respect. And as for other Trees, there hath been a great destruction made of them in many places by this Storm. Several were blown down at <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi> And three thousand brave Oaks at least, but in one principal part of the Forrest of <hi>Dean,</hi> belonging to his Majesty. In a little Grove at
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56129:27"/>
                  <hi>Ipswich,</hi> belonging to the Lord of <hi>Hereford</hi> (which, together with the Spire of the Steeple before-mentioned, were the most considerable Ornaments of that Town) are blown down at least two hundred goodly Trees, one of which was an Ash, which had ten load of Wood upon it: there are now few Trees left there.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Brampton-Bryan Park</hi> in the County of <hi>Hereford,</hi> belonging to Sir <hi>Edward Harly,</hi> one of the late Knights of the <hi>Bath,</hi> above thirteen hundred Trees are blown down; and above six hundred in <hi>Hopton Park</hi> not far from it: and thus it is proportionably in most places where this Storm was felt. And the truth is, the dammage which the People of this Nation have sustained upon all accounts by this Storm is not easily to be valued: some sober and discreet People, who have endeavoured to compute the Loss of the several Counties one with another, by the destruction of Houses and Barns, the blowing away of Hovels and Reeks of Corn, the falling of Trees, &amp;c. do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it can come to little less than two Millions of Money.</p>
               <p>There are yet behind many particulars of a distinct nature from those which have been spoken of; some whereof are very wonderful, and call for a very serious observation of them.</p>
               <p>In the City of <hi>Hereford,</hi> several persons were by the violence of the Wind born up from the ground, one man (as it is credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) at least six yards.</p>
               <p>In the City of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> especially on the Bridge and near <hi>Wallingford-house,</hi> several persons were blown down one on the top of another.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hertfordshire</hi> a man was taken up, carried a pole in length, and blown over a very high hedge; and the like in other places.</p>
               <p>The Water in the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and other places, was in a very strange manner blown up into the Air: Yea, in the new Pond in <hi>James's Park,</hi> the Fish, to the number of at least two hundred, were blown out and lay by the Bank-side, whereof many were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Moreclack</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> the Birds as they attempted to fly, were beaten down to the ground by violence of the Wind.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Epping</hi> in the County of <hi>Essex,</hi> a very great Oak was blown down, which of it self was raised again, and doth grow firmly at this day.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Taunton,</hi> a great Tree was blown down, the upper part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of rested upon a Brick or Stone-wall, and after a little time, by the force of the Wind, the lower part of the Tree was blown quite over the Wall.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56129:27"/>
               <p>The great Fane at <hi>Whitehall</hi> was blown down; and one of the four which were upon the <hi>white Tower,</hi> and two more of them strangely bent; which is to be seen at this day, to the admiration of all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them.</p>
               <p>The several <hi>Triumphant Arches</hi> in the City of <hi>London</hi> were much shattered and torn; that in <hi>Leaden-hall-street</hi> lost the Kings Arms, and many other rare pieces that were affixed to it. That in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> which represented the Church, suffered very much also by the fury of the Storm. And a great part of that in <hi>Fleetstreet</hi> (which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented Plenty) was blown down; but, blessed be God, none that we hear of were either killed or hurt by the fall of it.</p>
               <p>The Wind was so strong that it blew down several Carts loaded with Hay in the Road between <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and in other Roads leading to the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Norwich-Coach</hi> with four or six horses, was not able to come forward towards <hi>London,</hi> but stayed by the way till the Storm was somewhat abated.</p>
               <p>It is also credibly reported, That all, or some of the Heads which were set upon <hi>Westminster-hall,</hi> were that day blown down.</p>
               <p>There was a very dreadful Lightning which did at first accompany the Storm, and by it, some of his Majesties Houshold conceive that the Fire which happened at <hi>White-hall</hi> that morning, was kindled; as also that at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> by which (as we are informed) seven or eight houses were burnt down.</p>
               <p>But before we close up our discourse upon this particular great work of God, we shall briefly give an account of a few signal and eminent Preservations which the Lord did that day vouchsafe to some who were in very great danger.</p>
               <p>One <hi>John Hall,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Rance</hi> in the County of <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi> being in his Chamber with three little Children, was sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly surprized with fear that the Room would be blown down, and would therefore needs immediately carry down all the three Children in his arms at once: He was no sooner down stairs with them, but presently (as he feared) the Room fell, and if any one of his Children had been left behind it had undoubtedly perished.</p>
               <p>The Lord also wrought a wonderful deliverance for divers of the City Ministers who were that day at the Morning-Lecture at <hi>John Zecheries</hi> Church near <hi>Goldsmiths-hall.</hi> It is usual with the Ministers after the Sermon is ended to go into the Vestry, and spend a little time in discourse together, while the Congregation is departing the place,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56129:28"/> which they did that morning also: but there being a fire in the Vestry, and the Wind so extream high, it blew the smoak down into the Room, which was so offensive to them that they did presently quit the Vestry and went to the Minister's house, which they had no sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, but a stack of Chimneys belonging to Sir <hi>James Drex</hi> his house, adjoyning to the Vestry, fell down upon it, and broke through it; and had not the Ministers, upon the fore-mentioned account, by a secret instinct of Providence been withdrawn, all or most of them had been destroyed, or at least very much hurt and maimed by that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blith</hi> the Attorney's man (of whom we have given some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count before) was also that day wonderfully preserved from perishing with his Master: for by reason of his stay, either to make water, or upon some other occasion, while his Master did run by a Riding-house near <hi>Pickadilla</hi> (which fell upon him and killed him) he escaped that danger, and was by a strange Providence preserved while his Master perished.</p>
               <p>The Countess of <hi>Rivers</hi> also having an House or Lodgings (as we are informed) about <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> being that morning in bed, was much importuned by one of her Servants (who was exceedingly afraid of the falling of a stack of Chimneys which was over the Room where her Ladiship lay) to rise immediately, lest she might be killed in her bed; which accordingly she did, and her Ladiship was no sooner up and departed the Room, but the Chimneys fell, and brake down into the Chamber, and at the least two Tuns of Brick and Rubbish were upon and about the Bed where the Countess lay, by which she had been certainly smothered had not her Servant prevailed with her to remove so seasonably, which was of the Lord, that she might not perish.</p>
               <p>Also a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> living at <hi>Bednal-Green,</hi> was by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hand of the Lord delivered that morning; for, according to his wonted course, he went into his Wash-house adjoyning to his Kitchen to wash his hands and face, which he had no sooner done, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the place, but immediately the Wash-house fell flat to the ground; and if the Lord had not at that very moment ordered by his Providence that he should go forth, he had certainly been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>
               <p>An honest man's son and servant in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> were that morning together in the Barn when it fell; and the servant was slain, but the son had only his hat beaten off his head, and received no other hurt.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:56129:28"/>
               <p>An eminent Citizen of <hi>London</hi> going that morning into <hi>Thames-Street</hi> to speak with a Friend upon some urgent occasions, as he returned, and in the very sight of his Friend, who waited on him to the door, a stack of Chimneys fell down, and to the apprehension of his Friend, and all that were near, he was covered with them: for, the Bricks and Rubbish in great abundance, fell round about him, and made so great a dust, that for some space of time they could not see him, and did verily believe he had been buried in the heap: But it pleased the Lord to protect him, that not so much as one Brick did touch him, to the great astonishment of himself and all the Spectators.</p>
               <p>We have also very credible Information, that near <hi>Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>burn</hi> in the County of <hi>Bedford,</hi> two men were the same morning threshing together in a Barn, which by the violence of the Wind was in a wonderful manner blown over them, so that by the fall of it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them sustained the least hurt.</p>
               <p>One thing more the Reader is desired to take notice of, That there was none of this Storm in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and all the Northren parts of <hi>England;</hi> and so likewise in <hi>Scotland:</hi> The Wind did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed blow a little more than ordinary, but it was not so high that they could call it a Storm; and so they suffered not those Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by it, which the people in other parts of the Nation did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. What the Lord's meaning in it is, further than to stir them up to thankfulness, Providence may in due time discover.</p>

               <p>About the time last mentioned, a Widow in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and in <hi>Dunstans</hi> Parish, was delivered of a strange Monster; the heart of it was in the outside of the body, and did hang in a long piece of flesh, which was about the neck of the Child, like the Ribbon of a Knight of the Garter in which his <hi>George</hi> hangs. When the woman was in the extremity of her pain, the Midwife prevailed with her to confess who was the Father of that she went with, and it proves to be a <hi>Runagado Priest,</hi> a true son of the Church (though as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age) and one of the three famous <hi>Georges</hi> that played the part of true Water-men in the Boat of the late <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> one that can preach in justification of the King's Death, as an act of great and honourable Justice; and if need be, swear home against those as Murderers who were Actors in it.

The Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife her self, with other of the good women who were at the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, have often related this story, and are ready to make it good against him before his Brethren that sit in Judicatory, in any of the <hi>Baudy Courts,</hi> within the Jurisdiction of the Right Reverend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (a Father of great and long experience in these affairs) Alwayes provided, that if the Priest be found guilty, he may not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to commute for Penance, but publickly undergo the same in the holy Vestment, washed very clean and white at the charge of the Parish, according to one of the Articles of Visitation, put forth by the Reverend Father his Name-sake of <hi>Winchester.</hi>

                  <hi>XXX.</hi> A Woman delivered of a Child, in a way contrary to the course of Nature.</head>
               <p>About the first of <hi>March,</hi> 1661, one <hi>Horsey's</hi> Wife a Taylor, and an Inhabitant of the City of <hi>Chichester,</hi> being at a Neighbours house upon occasion of laying Plaisters to one there that had been sick of an Ague; before she could dispatch what she went about, was taken very ill, insomuch that the man's wife where she was, and some other women that were present, fearing that she would miscarry, prevailed with her to go up into a Chamber where they made ready a Bed for her. Being now exercised with very great pain and illness, she did earnestly desire some stale Beer, and after she had drunk of it, she grew exceeding sick in her Stomach, and immediately fell to vomiting very violently; and at last contrary to nature, did vomit up a male Child, almost a span long, very perfect in every part, without any deformity. She was so very weak and ill after it, that she could not go home to her house in almost three weeks time following. This is a thing so strange, and so contrary to the ordinary course of nature, that we had not the confidence to publish it, but that we have received the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it over and over again; the Woman her self, as also all those who were at that time present with her, constantly owning and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the truth of it. But in regard of the strangeness of the thing, we are not without our fears, lest there should be some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take about it; therefore we are not forward to impose the belief of it upon any: however we have put down things so particularly, that the

                  <hi>XXXIV.</hi> A strange Inscription round about a Brass Kettle.</head>
               <p>We suppose it is generally known and believed what happened at <hi>Edmunds Bury</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> on the second of <hi>March,</hi> 1661, concerning that strange Inscription round about a Brass Kettle, seen and read by the man and his wife who are owners of the Kettle; and by four or five other persons besides. What the words were it is not convenient to relate, it being of a dangerous consequence to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them; fearing lest indiscreet persons, and ill-affected, should make an ill construction and application of them: And besides, we are not without our jealousies, lest there should be something of Sorcery in it. We shall therefore only give a short account of some of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances relating to this Story, whereof we have had a very true Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from unquestionable hands.</p>
               <p>The words were all in the English tongue, and written in one line quite round the Kettle; the letters were Roman Characters plain and legible: none of the words, except the word <hi>MOLECH,</hi> were writ in Capital Letters: all was written in words at length, and not in figures: The letters seemed to be of a blackish colour; written, not engraven, and, in the apprehension of the Spectators, sticking very close to the Brass, and more even with the Superfeces than Ink upon Paper. They endeavoured to wipe it out with a cloth, but could not: Yea, after that, the letters seemed more bright and clear than before. The Inscription continued about the space of a quarter of an hour, and then vanished as the dew before the Sun, only the word <hi>Molech</hi> continued a little longer than the rest.</p>

Several of the Leaves of the said Trees were afterwards sent abroad to divers persons in the Country, who had a desire to see them, and the Blood was dryed upon them, and they seemed as if they had been coloured and dyed therewith.

               <p>Upon the 19th of <hi>June,</hi> a reverend and godly Minister, one of the King's Chaplains, as he was travelling with his man between <hi>Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn</hi> and <hi>Dorchester,</hi> saw a great Troop of Horse upon the top of an Hill with Colours flying, some of them alighted and walked down the Hill: his man also saw the same, and did both really believe that they were a Troop of Horse, insomuch, that they put on and rode hard, that they might get into <hi>Dorchester</hi> before the Horsemen, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themselves of convenient quarters. But they still expecting when the Troop should come, and none coming, upon enquiry found that there were really no Horsmen thereabouts that day; so that it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed, that this Troop did belong to the Regiment that was seen in <hi>Wales,</hi> whereof account hath been given before.

               <p>About the 7th of <hi>July</hi> 1662, from very good hands it is assured, that it rained Blood at <hi>Sherrington</hi> and <hi>Lathbury,</hi> two Towns in <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinghamshire</hi> near <hi>Newport-Pannel.</hi> It stood in puddles in one yard in <hi>Sherrington;</hi> others having hung out their Linen upon the Hedges to dry, found them spotted all over with drops of Blood: Some who were abroad, found many drops of it upon their Clothes. The People there are very sensible of this, and much affrighted at it, none questioning the truth of it.</p>

               <p>Upon the 8th of <hi>July</hi> 1662, a Servant to a very honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and one of the Lords of the Council, travelling in the mid-way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Farnham</hi> and <hi>Bagshot,</hi> in a great storm of Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, saw a very great Fire on the Heath flaming up very furiously; he rode to it, and though it rained excessively, yet he saw it burn up a good part of the Heath; and notwithstanding the exceeding greatness of the Rain, yet it could not quench it, at which he was much start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and amazed, and came away and left it burning. When he came to Town, he related it to his Lord, who believes it to be true, and (though one of the wisest men in <hi>England</hi>) seems to be much affected with it when he discourseth of it, which his Lordship hath often done before Persons of Quality and Honour; by which means we came to the knowledge of it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>On the day before-mentioned, about nine of the clock at night, a person of much honesty and sobriety was with his son and his servant going home to his house at <hi>Gillingham,</hi> near <hi>Chatham</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> and about two fields from <hi>Chatham</hi> as they were going, there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56129:32"/> appeared suddenly a great Light from the Northwest, and by it they plainly saw before them, and not far from them, the appearance of a Sea, and at the East end of it a great and thick Fog; it was (as near as they could guess) about a mile in length. Then they saw betwixt the Light and the Sea, the appearance of a Ship under sail pressing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on its course, and sailing with great swiftness. Then immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately all vanished: But presently, the Light, Sea, and Fog appeared again, as also a second Ship bigger than the first, sailing alike course with the former, only it was not so near them: there seemed to lye a point of Land, much like the <hi>North-foreland,</hi> which the Ship laboured to get about. This in appearance seemed to be in a valley, and near to them, though the ground was no valley: as they beheld it, all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared again, and nothing was seen. After this the Light appeared again, and the Fog and the Sea also, spreading themselves towards them as before, and seemed to be but in the next field from them. Beyond the Water appeared a Church, and upon the Water two or three Boats, which they plainly saw (for the Light made all things so clear as if it had been a Sunshine day) At length the Body of the Church was struck off and turned into the Body of a Tree, with a thick sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding top, then presently it turned into two or three hillocks of Smoak, and so vanished, and the Light, Water, and Fog withdrew again. But all presently appeared again, and were so placed directly before them, that they thought, if it should so continue, they could not get home. Beyond the Water, a Church-steeple, bigger than the former, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; it rose as it were out of a Hill, and sunk right down immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then all disappeared. But soon after the same Light, Fog and Water appeared again, and then they heard a very strange noise, as if it had been of an Army of Men, at which the Boy being very much affrighted, did cling about his Father, saying, <hi>Father, yonder be Men;</hi> but they saw none, only they heard an noise, as if it had been of an Army of Men talking together, and making Fires as in a Leagure, two or three sparks of fire proceeding from the place where the noise was, and vanished away in smoak. Then in the Eastermost end of the Fog, they saw the appearance of a Serpent, with a sting in the mouth; the head was to the West, and the tayl to the East: After this, all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and the Sky and all things about them were as before this Appearance, which came forth in these four several Scenes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued about three quarters of an hour. The whole is attested by one of the Spectators, who hath given it in <hi>verbatim,</hi> under his own hand.</p>

They were perfectly seen two dayes together, and on the third day there remained only some marks of them, which looked like rotten and putrified blood.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56129:34"/> Ships coming very near them, and were sorely afraid that they should have been boarded by them, and therefore the Waterman did present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestir himself to get out of their way, but his Boat stuck fast, and he was not able to move it in the least: he thought at first he had been on ground, but finding it was not so, he attempted again to row, but could not make his Boat stir. The Ships now being very near them, on a sudden one of them was turned into the likeness of a very tall Man, of a most monstrous shape, about twenty foot in height as they conceived. Upon this, the person in the Boat being extreamly affrighted, fell on praying, and immediately that Appearance stood still, and was turned on one side; they being very near it, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it about half an hour, did plainly discover the form of its countenance, and also its hair; at length they plainly saw fire come out of its belly, and then it moved towards the bank-side, and there he saw it consume away as if it had been a barrel of Pitch on fire, and so it vanished. The other Ship was turned into the form of a Castle, but they were so intent in fixing their eyes upon the former, that they can give no further account of the latter. After both of them were vanished the Waterman was able to move his Boat, but not before, and then they proceeded on their voyage, and have often since repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what is here related, and do constantly affirm the truth of it, as some of the Contributers to this Collection can testifie, who received the whole from their own mouths.</p>

               <p>First, there appeared a brown sandy Bay, with several great Bodies of Men upon it, and from them marched several Parties, and wheeled

And in a short space of time after, the sand appeared again, and the men marching, and a ship coming in under saile, sailed towards them.

Some part of the day the Pond is wholly freed of it, and is as clear as at other times. It is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible some Natural Cause may be assigned of it, however, as a Work of God, it is not to be slighted, or neglected; especially considering that some who have lived there forty or fifty Years, have never observed any such thing before. There is one thing further relating to this particular, very remarkable, that for a week or two last past, about twelve of the clock at noon every day, the Redness begins to abate upon the surface of the Water, and all the afternoon, the Pond is green until the next morning about seven of the Clock, and then by degrees the red Scum en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases, till the Pond be wholly covered with it.</p>

               <p>About the Month of <hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> 1661. an Episcopal Parson living about <hi>Brent-wood</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> being at that Town on a Fair or Market day, did there drink to great excess, insomuch that as he came home at night, he fell from his Horse, and by that fall was killed and taken away in his sin.

Four Men did swear a Riot against them, and within less than four dayes immediately following, three of them, being young, lusty, and healthful men, were suddenly cut off by Death, the fourth lay also in a sad manner, and it was expected also that he would die presently; but whether he hath since recovered or no, we have not heard.</p>

               <p>At <hi>Wanford</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> on the 30th. of <hi>July,</hi> 1661. one Mr. <hi>Absolom,</hi> an Inhabitant there, provided a Barrel of extraordinary Srong-Bear for his Landlord, Sr. <hi>John Rouse</hi> a Parliament-man, and some other Company, <hi>viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Lemon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dougate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Terril,</hi> and others; they all met at the said Mr. <hi>Absoloms</hi> House, about two of the clock in the afternoon, the day before mentioned; they drunk very freely, being met together for that very purpose; and when they were in their Cups, they began to revile and raile against some honest Christians, who lived not far from the place, and did indeed in that humour, very severely threaten all the Phanaticks; and as one of the Company hath confessed, they begun a very strange and unheard of Health, it was so horrid that the Gentleman would not name what it was, but cryed out very bitterly against it, and Sr. <hi>John Rouse,</hi> who began it. And as they were thus Blaspheming God, railing against his People, and abusing themselves and the good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, the Lord sent a great Storm from the South-east,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56129:37"/> and with it a very dreadful clap of Thunder, which was as a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piece to them; and within a quarter of an hour after another, and with that a terrible flash of Lightning, which came down with so great force upon the north side of the House, that brake thorow the Tyles and came into a Chamber which was over the Room where the Persons before mentioned were Drinking and Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it shook in pieces the Bedstead there, and then came down into the lower Room where the Gentlemen were; it threw one of them upon the Table, and wounded and bruised another of them extreamly, that he was forced to keep his Bed a great while after; it struck a third of them dead, who was burnt as black as a coal; and as the Jury affirmed, was the sadest Corps that ever was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held; all the rest so afrighted and amazed, that they were for the present as dead men: After this it went out at the South side of the House, and made as great a breach there as it did upon its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, on the other side of it. This is a Story so publickly known to be true, that none in the Country hath the Impudence to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: Onely we do earnestly beg of the Lord that one evidence more of the truth of this Relation may be added to the rest, that the Gentlemen who are the survivors of this Eminent stroak from Heaven, may understand and be sensible of the meaning of it, and speedily repent and reform, lest God reserves them to be more signal Examples hereafter of his Wrath and Vengeance.</p>

               <p>Not long after the time last mentioned, Mr. <hi>Ince</hi> the Faithful, able Minister before spoken of, was by Violence and Oppression driven out of his Living, and the Malice of some of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants being so great against him, meerly for Righteousness sake, it was not judged safe for him to abide in the Town any longer, whereupon he resolved suddenly to remove to some other place; and in order thereunto, Wagons were provided to carry away his Goods, which one Mr. <hi>Moullins</hi> (an Inhabitant of the said Town of <hi>Dunhead,</hi> and a great Enemy to Mr. <hi>Ince</hi>) seeing, the night before Mr. <hi>Inces</hi> departure, expressed a greater deal of Joy at it, and did openly speak Words to this effect; <hi>To morrow when this</hi> Ince <hi>goes away, I will keep the Merriest day that ever I kept in Dunhead:</hi> But when the morrow came, the Lord by a sad hand of providence quite changed the Scene, and made him keep one of the most Sorrowful dayes he ever kept in his whole Life before; for that day going forth in the morning with his Cart, his Foot slipped, and falling down he was not able suddenly to recover himself, and the Wheel of the Cart went over his Leg and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it very sorely, so that he lay all that day in extream pain and dolor, at last it Gangrened, and after two or three dayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Torment, he miserably ended his Life.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56129:41"/> of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> two miles from <hi>Bury,</hi> a violent Adversary to the Gospel, and the Faithful Preachers and Professors thereof, did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times instigate the Constable of the said Town, to present certain Conscientious and Peaceable men for not coming to the Parish-Church to hear Service; but the Constable did not at all hearken to him therein, being unwilling to have his hand in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting and Molesting any of his Godly Neighbours: Upon which the said <hi>Covel</hi> was so enraged, that he wished his Horse might sink under him if he did not indict the Constable at the next Sessions, because he neglected (as he affirmed) his Duty, in not Presenting those honest Men, who refused to hear the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer: But it pleased the Lord to rebuke the rage and madness of this Man; for about the latter end of the Month of <hi>November,</hi> 1661. before the time of the Sessions, upon a Market day, coming from <hi>Bury,</hi> and riding into a Pond not far from his own House, to wash his Horse, as he was wont to do, his Horse (which never used to do so before) did sink under him into the Water, where he was in danger of being immediately Drowned, being sometimes under the Water, and sometimes above Water, as himself confessed afterward; but it pleased the Lord, that one coming by and seeing him in this Condition, did presently call forth some of his own Family, who came seasonably to his help, and got him out of the Pond before he was Drowned. But though he escaped then, yet the hand of the Lord did still follow him, for he soon after fell into a violent Feaver, whereof in short time he dyed. And this is yet further to be noted, that he was the man, who a little before his Death, did put the Parish to about 80. <abbr>l.</abbr> Charge, by reason of his extraordinary busling to get the Bells new Run, and new Hanged: And it pleased God that he was the first in the Parish for whom the Death Bell did Ring, after the new hanging of the Bells. The certain truth of this whole Relation is attested by very many honest Persons, Inhabitants of the said Town.</p>

                  <hi>XXI.</hi> A Railing Prelate, Smitten by the Lord with a sad Tormenting Disease.</head>
               <p>About the Month of <hi>January,</hi> 1661. a reverend gaudy Prelate, did put forth a Book in Print, Intituled, <hi>A Pillar of Gratitude,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:56129:41"/> humbly dedicated to the Glory of God, the Honour of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, &amp;c. in which Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 62. (having before in many Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical strains, bitterly Scolded against his Quondam fellow Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanteers) he hath this angry and uncharitable passage; <hi>That the Projects of the Presbyterians have Froth in their Head, and Blood in their bottom; as the Water of those men who labour with the Stone, and Strangury, and have their Wounds from within.</hi> It pleased God within a few dayes after the publishing of this Book, to smite the Bishop with that tormenting distemper, which he there makes use of, to set off his false and scandalous Impeachment of so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable a part of the most conscientious and peaceable People in the Land. He lay in very great extremity of Torture, and by reason of the Stopping of his Water, his Life was in great hazard, and so was forced to send for a Chyrurgion, who by making use of his Probe, did help him to make water, which was Froth at the top, and blood at bottom: And that the Lord might make him yet more sensible of it, he repeated the stroak a second time after the same manner, as we have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from very eminent and considerable Persons. We could heartily wish, that there were now alive another Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> of <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> who would deal effectually with the Conscience of this proud frothy Prelate, that he might be blessed with a more sanctified use of the hand of the Lord, in his Visitation of the Strangury, then of his broken Leg, in the former times.</p>

                  <hi>XXII.</hi> An Apostate Minister, struck with sudden Death, by the immediate hand of the Lord.</head>
               <p>About the end of <hi>December,</hi> or beginning of <hi>January,</hi> 1661. one Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> minister of <hi>Bettus,</hi> in the County of <hi>Salop,</hi> who formerly was very zealous for Reformation in the Presbyterian way, and of late became a great Conformist; upon a Munday Morning (after he had Preached and Conformed the day before) going very well out of his House to lead a Colt to the Water (his Servant at that time being otherwise imployed) was suddenly smitten by an Hand from Heaven, and returning presently into his House, and looking with a very pale and dejected Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, his Wife asked him how it was with him? to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56129:42"/> Oh! the hand of the Lord is upon me, or Words to that effect; he immediately took his Bed, and within a very short time dyed. The Jury that sate upon him, could find nothing about his Body that might occasion his so sudden Death; only there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a small print of a Blow or Wound between his two Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: But that which is further observable in this Story, is, That every night in the week before the Death of this Minister, the Parish-Church Door was flung open, though locked very fast all the day before. One evening especially, two very sufficient Men of the Town, finding the Door open, lockt it very fast, and tryed with all their strength to break it open, but could not; then they departed, and within an hour after returned and found the Door wide open. Also three Nights in the same Week, <hi>viz. Munday, Wednesday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> the Bell of the same Church (there being but one) was heard to Ring several times of its own accord. The truth of this whole Relation is attested by the Inhabitants of the Town before mentioned.</p>

            <head>THE CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>VVE shall not any further at present enlarge this Narrative, lest we make the Book to swell in price beyond the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the generallity of the People, (who are all equally concerned in these things) to compass it. There are about half a Century of particulars yet behind, some of which are as, if not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable than any that are here published, which in another Book by themselves, if the Lord give opportunity, shall immediately within few dayes succeed these, which are here offered to the World. In the mean time we cannot but hope for so much Charity from all ingenious, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious Men, into whose hands this account may fall, as to be candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpreted in this undertaking, and that they will believe, we have here set down nothing, but what hath been communicated to us from persons whom <hi>we at least</hi> esteem of unblemisted Credit and Reputation. We will not be confident but that there may be some Mistakes, (it being very hard for a Story to be the same in the Translation which it was in the Original;) but this we can confidently avow, that there is not the least Forgery, nor <hi>wilful</hi> Mistake in the whole Work; and we hope that none have abused us in our Intelligence, which we also have examined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with all the Caution imaginable; and therefore do believe that the Reader upon enquiry will find no ground for any material Exception to any part of this or the succeeding Collection. We shall close up all with that <hi>Doxology</hi> of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. <hi>72.17, 18. Blessed be the Lord God of</hi> Israel, <hi>who onely doth wondrous things: And blessed be his glorious Name for ever, and let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory;</hi> Amen, <hi>and</hi> Amen.</p>
